(they don't have to deal with it!) \n\n4 - While the installer is running DO NOT INTERRUPT IT! or you will end up with a corrupted system. \n\n5 - Try to use "pikman" instead of "apt" when using the terminal, it is much faster! \n\n6 - You understand the xone driver downloads needed binaries locally and does not directly package or distribute any copyrighted firmware or other related data. \n\n8 - LUKS Encryption does not currently work in manual partitioning mode, if you want a custom partitoning scheme use the pikainstall terminal installer \n\n9 - Manual partitioning will format all selected partitons, so if you want to dualboot make a separate EFI partition for PikaOS, again if you don't want that use the pikainstall terminal installer \n\n10 - Make sure to double check the fstype in the final dialog when doing manual partitioning if it's wrong then return to partitioning step and use gprated to set the filesystem to '"'cleared'"'  \n\n11 - In case you need the login info for this session: \n\n - username: "pikaos" \n\n - password: ""\n\n\n\'MEANING: JUST PRESS ENTER' "`"
